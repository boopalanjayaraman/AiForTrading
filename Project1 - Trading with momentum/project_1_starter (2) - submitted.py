# # Project 1: Trading with Momentum
# ## Instructions
# Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.
# 
# ## Packages
# When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.
# 
# The other packages that we're importing are `helper`, `project_helper`, and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `helper` and `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.
# 
# ### Install Packages

# In[1]:


import sys
get_ipython().system('{sys.executable} -m pip install -r requirements.txt')


# ### Load Packages

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import helper
import project_helper
import project_tests


# ## Market Data
# ### Load Data
# The data we use for most of the projects is end of day data. This contains data for many stocks, but we'll be looking at stocks in the S&P 500. We also made things a little easier to run by narrowing down our range of time period instead of using all of the data.

# In[3]:


df = pd.read_csv('../../data/project_1/eod-quotemedia.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col=False)

close = df.reset_index().pivot(index='date', columns='ticker', values='adj_close')

print('Loaded Data')


# ### View Data
# Run the cell below to see what the data looks like for `close`.

# In[4]:


project_helper.print_dataframe(close)


# ### Stock Example
# Let's see what a single stock looks like from the closing prices. For this example and future display examples in this project, we'll use Apple's stock (AAPL). If we tried to graph all the stocks, it would be too much information.

# In[5]:


apple_ticker = 'AAPL'
project_helper.plot_stock(close[apple_ticker], '{} Stock'.format(apple_ticker))


# ## Resample Adjusted Prices
# 
# The trading signal you'll develop in this project does not need to be based on daily prices, for instance, you can use month-end prices to perform trading once a month. To do this, you must first resample the daily adjusted closing prices into monthly buckets, and select the last observation of each month.
# 
# Implement the `resample_prices` to resample `close_prices` at the sampling frequency of `freq`.

# In[52]:


def resample_prices(close_prices, freq='M'):
    """
    Resample close prices for each ticker at specified frequency.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    close_prices : DataFrame
        Close prices for each ticker and date
    freq : str

# ## Compute Log Returns
# 
# Compute log returns ($R_t$) from prices ($P_t$) as your primary momentum indicator:
# 
# $$R_t = log_e(P_t) - log_e(P_{t-1})$$
# 
# Implement the `compute_log_returns` function below, such that it accepts a dataframe (like one returned by `resample_prices`), and produces a similar dataframe of log returns. Use Numpy's [log function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.log.html) to help you calculate the log returns.

# ## Shift Returns
# Implement the `shift_returns` function to shift the log returns to the previous or future returns in the time series. For example, the parameter `shift_n` is 2 and `returns` is the following:
# 
# ```
#                            Returns
#                A         B         C         D

# 2013-07-09     0.037     0.095     0.027     0.063     ...

# ...            ...       ...       ...       ...
# ```
# 
# the output of the `shift_returns` function would be:
# ```
#                         Shift Returns
#                A         B         C         D

# ## Generate Trading Signal
# 
# A trading signal is a sequence of trading actions, or results that can be used to take trading actions. A common form is to produce a "long" and "short" portfolio of stocks on each date (e.g. end of each month, or whatever frequency you desire to trade at). This signal can be interpreted as rebalancing your portfolio on each of those dates, entering long ("buy") and short ("sell") positions as indicated.
# 
# Here's a strategy that we will try:
# > For each month-end observation period, rank the stocks by _previous_ returns, from the highest to the lowest. Select the top performing stocks for the long portfolio, and the bottom performing stocks for the short portfolio.
# 
# Implement the `get_top_n` function to get the top performing stock for each month. Get the top performing stocks from `prev_returns` by assigning them a value of 1. For all other stocks, give them a value of 0. For example, using the following `prev_returns`:
# 
# ```
#                                      Previous Returns
#                A         B         C         D         E         F         G
# 2013-07-08     0.015     0.082     0.096     0.020     0.075     0.043     0.074
# 2013-07-09     0.037     0.095     0.027     0.063     0.024     0.086     0.025
# ...            ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...
# ```
# 
# The function `get_top_n` with `top_n` set to 3 should return the following:
# ```
#                                      Previous Returns
#                A         B         C         D         E         F         G
# 2013-07-08     0         1         1         0         1         0         0
# 2013-07-09     0         1         0         1         0         1         0
# ...            ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...

# Implement the `portfolio_returns` function to compute the expected portfolio returns. Using `df_long` to indicate which stocks to long and `df_short` to indicate which stocks to short, calculate the returns using `lookahead_returns`. To help with calculation, we've provided you with `n_stocks` as the number of stocks we're investing in a single period.

# The annualized rate of return allows you to compare the rate of return from this strategy to other quoted rates of return, which are usually quoted on an annual basis. 
# 
# ### T-Test
# Our null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the actual mean return from the signal is zero. We'll perform a one-sample, one-sided t-test on the observed mean return, to see if we can reject $H_0$.
# 
# We'll need to first compute the t-statistic, and then find its corresponding p-value. The p-value will indicate the probability of observing a mean return equally or more extreme than the one we observed if the null hypothesis were true. A small p-value means that the chance of observing the mean we observed under the null hypothesis is small, and thus casts doubt on the null hypothesis. It's good practice to set a desired level of significance or alpha ($\alpha$) _before_ computing the p-value, and then reject the null hypothesis if $p < \alpha$.
# 
# For this project, we'll use $\alpha = 0.05$, since it's a common value to use.
# 
# Implement the `analyze_alpha` function to perform a t-test on the sample of portfolio returns. We've imported the `scipy.stats` module for you to perform the t-test.
# 
# Note: [`scipy.stats.ttest_1samp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.0.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_1samp.html) performs a two-sided test, so divide the p-value by 2 to get 1-sided p-value
